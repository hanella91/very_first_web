  <h2>China</h2>
  East Asia or Northeast Asia is the northeastern subregion of Asia, which can be defined in both geographical or ethno-cultural terms.[3][4] Generally, the modern states of East Asia include China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan.[5] The East Asian states of China, North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan are all unrecognized by at least one other East Asian state due to severe ongoing political tensions in the region, specifically the division of Korea and the political status of Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau, two small coastal quasi-dependent territories located in the south of China, are officially highly autonomous but are under de jure Chinese sovereignty. Siberia borders East Asia's north, Southeast Asia the south, South Asia the southwest and Central Asia the west. To the east is the Pacific Ocean and to the southeast is Micronesia (a Pacific Ocean island group, classified as part of Oceania)
